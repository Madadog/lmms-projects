# What's this?
Just a couple [LMMS](https://github.com/LMMS/lmms) projects I made. 

Some projects require Nightly LMMS (1.3.0-alpha)

Some projects may be incomplete, or Just Plain Badâ„¢

# Soundfonts and Samples
While some projects will work out of the box (such as [`whee-riff-man.mmpz`](/projects/whee-riff-man.mmpz)), some projects will require you to download some of these soundfonts and put them in your `lmms/samples/soundfonts/` folder:

Soundfont| Link|-

Yet Another Earthbound Soundfont:| https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/665/Earthbound_NEW.sf2|-
Probably a couple more I forgot|World Wide Web|-

... As for the missing drums and other samples, there can be no help: You will just have to replace them with stock LMMS samples and see how it goes.

Also there are some Carla instances. They don't work for me either.

I don't think there are any VSTS, but if there are, just replace them with the default TripleOscillator. Enjoy the clipping.

# TODO
* Upload renders
* Add Ardour projects? (Blocking on Very Large File Size)
    * Use Ardour's archive feature??? 
        * Pros: Soundfonts are bundled.
        * Cons: Soundfonts are bundled. ~200mb per Ardour project. What's Github's storage limit?
* Remove backup files
